1,356,356,"On 8 June 1948, the first car to bear the Porsche name was road-certified: the Porsche 356/1 Roadster produced in Gmünd (in Carinthia, Austria).

The ""Gmünd Roadster"" was powered by a 1.1-liter air-cooled flat-four engine from Volkswagen. The engine's power was increased to 35 hp for the 356. The roadster weighed just 585 kilograms and reached speeds of up to 135 km/h (83 mph).

The original 356 (also called ""pre-A"") is easy to recognize from its two-piece windscreen divided by a center bar. This was replaced by a single-piece windscreen with a center bend as of model year 1952.
All 356 generations were also available in an open-top version (Cabriolet, Speedster or Roadster).",/images/Id_b_1.jpg
2,356,356 A,"In model year 1956, the 356 was replaced by the comprehensively enhanced 356 A. As from its market launch, this type was available with five four-cylinder engines:

- 356 A 1300 with 44 hp
- 356 A 1300 Super with 60 hp
- 356 1600 with 60 hp
- 356 A 1600 Super with 75 hp
- 356 A 1500 GS Carrera with 100 hp

The modifications to the vehicle were part of ""Technical Programme 1"" (T1). One of the key visual differences between the A series and the original 356 was a single-piece, curved panoramic windscreen. The front indicators were always integrated in the horn grille and all models had a modified front lid handle with inset Porsche Crest. The tail lights were teardrop-shaped as of 03/1957.

The 1300 models were discontinued in model year 1958 (T2). The tailpipes of the 1600 models ended between the bumper guards to give more ground clearance. The chrome-plated housing with number plate lighting and reversing light was mounted below the number plate.

All 356 generations were also available in an open-top version (Cabriolet, Speedster or Convertible D).

From the type 356 onwards, particularly sporty versions were given the additional designation ""Carrera"" and were powered by a Fuhrmann engine.

This power unit, named after designer Ernst Fuhrmann, was characterised by four overhead camshafts, which were driven by bevel-gear shafts. The engine also featured a dual ignition with two separate distributors.",/images/Id_b_2.jpg
3,356,356 B,"In model year 1960, the 356 A was replaced by the completely redesigned 356 B (T5). Its power spectrum ranged from 60 hp in the 356 B 1600 to 140 hp in the 356 B 2000 GS-GT Carrera 2.

The key visual differences between the B series and the previous model included the front bumper with enlarged rim guards, which was positioned approx. ten centimetres higher, and the headlights, which were also positioned much higher. The horn grilles next to the further-protruding front indicators were flatter and featured two chrome-plated slats. The front lid handle was also wider at the bottom. The two lamps for the number plate lighting were integrated in the higher-positioned rear bumper, while the reversing light was mounted below the bumper.

For model year 1962 (T6), the 356 B received a front lid that had been significantly widened at the bottom and a tank cap in the front right wing. Two vertical ventilation grilles were integrated in the enlarged bonnet.

All 356 generations were also available in an open-top version (Cabriolet, Speedster or Roadster).

From the type 365 A onwards, particularly sporty versions were given the additional designation ""Carrera"" and were powered by a Fuhrmann engine.

This power unit, named after designer Ernst Fuhrmann, was characterised by four overhead camshafts, which were driven by bevel-gear shafts. The engine also featured a dual ignition with two separate distributors.",/images/Id_b_3.jpg
4,356,356 C,"In model year 1964, the 356 C replaced the 356 B. The range of engines was reduced to three and the existing 60 hp variant was discontinued. Instead, the 75 hp engine of the B 1600 Super represented the entry-level engine. The top-of-the-range engine in the 356 C 2000 GS Carrera delivered a power output of 130 hp.

Visually, there was very little difference between the C series and the B series. One striking change was the modified rims with flatter hub caps without Porsche Crest. The new hub cap design was the result of the fact that all 356 models were now equipped with disc brakes as standard. The B type also featured a round exterior mirror.

The last Porsche 356 C was delivered in May 1966.

All 356 generations were also available in an open-top version (Cabriolet, Speedster or Roadster).

From the type 365 A onwards, particularly sporty versions were given the additional designation ""Carrera"" and were powered by a Fuhrmann engine.

This power unit, named after designer Ernst Fuhrmann, was characterised by four overhead camshafts, which were driven by bevel-gear shafts. The engine also featured a dual ignition with two separate distributors.",/images/Id_b_4.jpg
5,911,901,"In September 1963, Porsche presented the Porsche 901 at the IAA in Frankfurt as a successor to the Porsche 356.

Series production of the 901 began in September 1964. When Porsche presented the vehicle at the Paris Motor Show in October of that year, the French car manufacturer Peugeot objected to the model designation. The reason: Peugeot had trademarked a three-digit type designation with a zero in the middle.

Porsche therefore renamed the 901 as the 911. This combination of numbers is the same as the emergency number in the USA and was therefore already well known in this key market for Porsche. 82 units of the 901 were produced before the name change.",/images/Id_b_5.jpg
6,911,911,"In September 1963, Porsche presented the Porsche 901 at the IAA in Frankfurt as a successor to the Porsche 356. One year later, as of model year 1965, series production of the model began and it was renamed the 911 shortly thereafter.

Originally built only as a Coupé, the 911 had an integral body-frame and was powered by a new 2.0-litre flat-six engine, which initially delivered 130 hp.

As of model year 1967, the 911 was also available as a ""safety cabriolet"" (Targa) with permanently mounted roll-over bar and removable soft top. As of model year 1969, the wheelbase was lengthened by 57 mm, resulting in increased driving comfort and simultaneously more stable driving dynamics.

The 911 S, the first engine derivative of the 911, was also launched on the market. In the years that followed, models bearing the additional designations T, L and E were launched.

911 Targa (1967-1973)
Porsche introduced the Targa model in response to increased safety requirements for open-top vehicles in the USA. Thanks to the fixed bar, the occupants were protected from injury in the event of the vehicle overturning.

911 S (MY 1967-73)
Due to various engine modifications, the sports version of the 911 initially had a power output of 160 hp, ultimately increasing to 190 hp. In addition to superior equipment, the S model was the first 911 to be given ""Fuchs"" rims with their distinctive 5-spoke design.

911 T (MY 1968-73)
The ""Touring"" version became the new entry-level model in the 911 family, initially developing 110 hp and later 130 hp. Its equipment matched that of the four-cylinder 912 model. One of the ways in which it could be distinguished from more powerful models was the fact that it had a silver rather than a gold logo.

911 L (MY 1968)
With the introduction of the T version as the new standard model, with a less powerful engine and 4-speed manual transmission, the previous 911 was renamed the 911 L. The engine remained unchanged.

911 E (MY 1969-73)
The existing 2.0-litre engines entered their final year of construction in MY 1969 and were replaced by new 2.2-litre engines. The L version was renamed the 911 E following the introduction of the new generation of engines and delivered power outputs of between 140 hp and 165 hp.",/images/Id_b_6.jpg
7,911,911 & 911S,"For model year 1974, the body design of the Porsche 911 was comprehensively redesigned for the first time. In addition to a Coupé and a Targa version, a Cabriolet was also available as of model year 1983.

The most striking feature of this 911 generation is the raised bumper design with black plastic bellows. Between the tail lights of the G models is a red panel and a Porsche logo that is red or black, depending on the model year. The rear number plate is flanked by two large rubber buffers with integrated number plate lighting.

The raised bumpers with bellows of the G models were the result of more stringent approval regulations in the USA. With the introduction of these regulations, bumpers had to be able to absorb impacts as a result of hitting a fixed obstacle at speeds of up to 5 mph (8 km/h) without damage to the body. To meet this requirement, vehicles for the US market had the bumpers connected to the body using hydraulic impact absorbers.

For models not intended for the US market, more cost-effective impact pipes were installed instead of these hydraulic impact absorbers. These had to be replaced after a rear-end collision. However, the impact absorbers could be ordered as optional equipment.

Surrounds/door handles
The 911 and 911 S had chrome-plated window surrounds and door handles.

Wheels
The 911 and 911 S were fitted with 15"" cast aluminium wheels from ATS as standard.

Exterior mirrors
The standard 911 model had chrome-plated exterior mirrors until MY 1975. 
As of MY 1976, larger, electrically adjustable exterior mirrors painted in the exterior colour were installed.
The 911 S only had chrome-plated exterior mirrors in MY 1974.

Engines
The standard 911 model had a flat-six engine with a displacement of 2.7 litres. This initially developed 150 hp and 165 hp as of MY 1976.
The engine of the 911 S delivered an output of 175 hp.

Headlamp rings
The headlamp rings of the 911/911 S were chrome-plated.",/images/Id_b_7.jpg
8,911,911 Carrera,"No Carrera models were produced from model years 1978 to 1983. The only model with naturally aspirated engine produced during this period was the 911 SC.

Surrounds/door handles
In contrast to the 911/911 S, the window surrounds and door handles of the Carrera models were anodised black.

Wheels
The 911 Carrera was fitted with 15"" forged alloy wheels from Fuchs as standard. 16"" wheels became standard as of MY 1989.

Exterior mirrors
The 911 Carrera models initially had chrome-plated exterior mirrors. As of MY 1976, larger, electrically adjustable exterior mirrors painted in the exterior colour were installed.

Engines
The displacement of the 911 Carrera engine was increased several times during the production period of the G series and the power output varied.
- MY 1974-75 - Displacement: 2.7 litres, power: 210 hp
- MY 1975-77 - Displacement: 3.0 litres, power: 200 hp
- MY 1984-89 - Displacement: 3.2 litres, power: 207 hp – 231 hp

Body
The body of the Carrera was slightly wider than that of the 911/911 S in the area of the rear wings.
Carrera models as of MY 1984 are recognisable by the side direction indicators in the front wings.
As of MY 1984, the 911 Carrera was optionally available with a front spoiler made from polyurethane (PU) and a flat rear wing with a black, hard rubber border, which was specifically designed for this model.

Headlamp rings
The headlamp rings of the 911 Carrera were initially chrome-plated, as of MY 1976 they were painted in the exterior colour.",/images/Id_b_8.jpg
9,911,911 SC,"In model year 1978, the 911 model range was reduced to two models. The 911 SC (Super Carrera) took the place of the 911 and Carrera models.

As of model year 1984, the SC version was again replaced by the 911 Carrera.

Surrounds/door handles
Until model year 1978, the window surrounds and door handles of the 911 SC were chrome-plated, like those of the previous 911 models; as of model year 1979, they were anodized black – as in the Carrera models.

Wheels
The 911 SC was fitted with 15"" cast aluminium wheels from ATS as standard.

Exterior mirrors
The exterior mirrors of the 911 SC were electrically adjustable and painted in the exterior color.

Engines
The 911 SC was powered by a 3.0-liter flat engine, the output of which was increased slightly over the years.- model year 1978-79 - 3.0 liters, 180 hp
- model year 1980 - 3.0 liters, 188 hp
- model year 1981-83 - 3.0 liters, 204 hp

Body
The 911 SC had the wider body of the 911 Carrera. Vehicles produced as of model year 1981 are recognizable from the side direction indicators behind the front wings.
As of model year 1983, the 911 SC Cabriolet became the first fully open-top 911 with fabric hood and was available along with the Coupé version and the Targa ""safety cabriolet"".

Headlamp rings
The headlamp rings of the 911 SC were initially chrome-plated, as of model year 1979 they were painted in the exterior color.",/images/Id_b_9.jpg
10,911,911 Turbo,"In model year 1975, thanks to turbocharging, a particularly powerful version of the Porsche 911 – the 911 Turbo – came onto the market.

Since its market launch in MY 1975, the 911 Turbo (initially named internally as the 930) has been the top-of-the-range model in the 911 model line.

The 930 featured flared rear wings, which gave it an extra 12 cm in width. Black stone guard film was applied in front of the rear wheel arches. The rear lid featured a distinctive rear wing with a wide black hard-rubber border.

Until MY 1977, the rear lid was made of glass fibre-reinforced plastic. As of MY 1978, the lid was made from sheet steel and the fixed plastic rear wing for mounting the charge-air cooler was made much bigger. The Turbo was also given an exhaust system with twin tailpipe. Exhaust gases only escaped through the left pipe when the boost-pressure control valve of the turbocharger was open.

As of MY 1987, the Turbo model was also available in the Targa and Cabriolet body types.For MY 1989, the 4-speed manual transmission was replaced with a 5-speed version.

Displacement/power:
- MY 1975-77 - 3.0 litres, 260 hp
- MY 1978-89 - 3.3 litres, 300 hp",/images/Id_b_10.jpg
11,912,912,"To bridge the price gap between the 356, which was still being produced at this time and the 911, in 1965 Porsche launched the 912 – a less expensive and significantly less powerful variant of the 911.

In terms of looks and technology, the 912 was virtually identical to the 911. Unlike the 911, however, it was powered by the 1.6-litre flat-four engine from the 356 SC at the rear. Its power output was reduced from 95 to 90 hp at 5,800 rpm for use in the 912 in order to give the engine more low-end torque and stability. Power transmission was provided by a 4-speed manual transmission.",/images/Id_b_11.jpg
12,912,912 E,"For the US market, a 912 E Coupé was also available in model year 1976. Its 2.0-litre flat-four engine delivered a power output of 90 hp. In appearance, the 912 resembled the 911 models of the G series.

However, it featured the dome hub caps of the original 911.",/images/Id_b_12.jpg
13,914,914,"The Porsche 914 was a joint development between Porsche and Volkswagen and was the new Porsche entry-level model as of model year 1970.

The two-seater, also known as the ""VW Porsche"", was a mid-engine Sports Car. Striking design features included the very long wheelbase for the vehicle length, short overhangs, the removable roof centre panel made from glass fiber-reinforced plastic as well as the wide safety bar. The 914 also featured pop-up headlights.

At the time of its launch, the 914 was available with two engines.
914: 1.7-liter flat-four engine with 80 hp from Volkswagen
914/6: 2.0-liter flat-six engine with 110 hp from the Porsche 911 T

These were followed by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with 100 hp based on the 1.7-liter engine in model year 1973 and a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine with 85 hp in model year 1974.

In the four-cylinder models the ignition lock was located on the right. The wheels of the 914 were mounted with four wheel nuts. The standard 914 model (914/4) was produced by body maker Karmann in Osnabrück.",/images/Id_b_13.jpg

914: 1.7-liter flat-four engine with 80 hp from Volkswagen
914-6: 2.0-liter flat-six engine with 110 hp from the Porsche 911 T

In the six-cylinder models, the ignition lock was located to the left of the steering wheel, where it is typically found in Porsche vehicles. The wheels of the 914-6 were mounted with five wheel nuts.

The 914-6 was built by Porsche at the main plant in Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen.",/images/Id_b_14.jpg
15,924,924,"The 924, which was available as of model year 1976, was developed by Porsche on behalf of Volkswagen as the successor to the 914 and eventually produced internally. The new entry-level model was built by Audi in Neckarsulm.

Good aerodynamics were a priority when designing the body of the 924. This was particularly taken into account through the flat bonnet and the pop-up headlights. As of MY 1983, a black rear spoiler brought about a further improvement in the Cd value.

Porsche went in an entirely new direction when designing the drive of the 924. For the very first time, a liquid-cooled front engine was used. This featured an in-line cylinder arrangement. The 125 hp engine was adopted from the Audi 100 and modified by Porsche. The drive power was transmitted according to the transaxle principle.

Only from the 924 S, which was produced as of model year 1986, onwards, was an engine built by Porsche used - the 2.5-litre four-cylinder in-line engine of the 944. The Porsche 924 S, which was available as of MY 1986, represented a significant technical enhancement of the 924 model line. Many components of this model originated in the 944. These included the power unit, brake system, chassis components as well as parts of the interior. The standard aluminium wheels with the ""telephone dial"" design also moved the 924 S closer to the 944. The 2.5-litre engine of the 924 S had the same design as the 944 and initially achieved 150 hp, followed by 160 hp as of MY 1988.",/images/Id_b_15.jpg
16,924,924 Turbo,"The Turbo version of the 924, which was available as of MY 1979, bridged the performance gap between the 924 and the 911 SC.

The body of the 924 Turbo was based on the 924. In the front section, it differed from the standard model through various air openings: 
- Vertical air slots in the front apron to supply air to the brakes and the oil cooler
- Four air openings between the headlights, as well as a NACA air opening on the right in the bonnet for aeration and ventilation of the engine compartment.

The 924 Turbo also featured a black rear spoiler on the rear lid. The aluminium wheels with spoke design were secured with five wheel nuts (like the standard 924 model) instead of four.
The supercharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder in-line engine of the 924 Turbo initially developed 170 hp. In MY 1981, the efficiency of the engine was improved and power output was increased to 177 hp.",/images/Id_b_16.jpg
17,928,928,"When designing the 928, which went into series production as of model year 1978, the focus was on lightweight construction. The doors, front wings and bonnet were therefore made from aluminium instead of sheet steel. Behind the plastic bumpers integrated in the body shape there were also aluminium profiles that could withstand a collision at up to 8 km/h (5 mph) without any damage.

The 928 had round, electrically operated pop-up headlights that were integrated in the wings. The rounded fastback was dominated by the large window of the rear lid.

The 928 models were powered by a water-cooled V8 engine with a 90° cylinder arrangement. The displacement of the power unit was increased from an initial 4.5 litres to 5.4 litres. Power was transmitted according to the transaxle principle.

To improve aerodynamics, the models were fitted with a front and rear spoiler from type 928 S (MY 1979) onwards.

The rear axle of the 928 was a completely new development. What made this double-wishbone suspension – also known as the Weissach axle – unique was its toe-in stabilising effect. This worked more or less as a passive rear-wheel steering, making a significant contribution to the active safety of the Gran Turismo.

928 (MY 1978-82)
The rounded rear end without rear spoiler was an unmistakable distinguishing feature of the 928. Unlike later derivatives, this model did not feature front or rear spoilers. The 4.5-litre engine of the 928 generated 240 hp.

928 S (MY 1980-86)
The 928 S had black front and rear spoilers, side protection strips painted in exterior colour and side direction indicators. The displacement increased from an initial 4.7 litres to 5.0 litres (MY 1986). The power output was 300 hp, increasing to 310 hp as of MY 1984 and 288 hp (with catalytic converter) as of MY 1986.

928 S4 (MY 1987-91)
The 928 S4 featured a rounded front apron with air intakes. The slanting rear end had a black rear wing that projected away from the body between the wide, flush-fitted tail lights. Its 5.0-litre engine produced 320 hp.",/images/Id_b_17.jpg
18,928,928 GT & GTS,"When designing the 928, which went into series production as of model year 1978, the focus was on lightweight construction.

928 GT (Spring 1989-MY 1991)
The 928 GT was sportier than the 928 S4. Thanks to various modifications, its power unit generated up to 330 hp. The GT was delivered as standard without side protection strips and with wheels in a unique design.

928 GTS (MY 1992-95)
The last evolutionary stage of the 928 model featured flared rear wings, a red light panel at the rear, a rear wing painted in exterior colour, exterior mirrors in the Cup design plus 17"" Cup rims as standard. The 5.4-litre engine of the GTS generated 350 hp.",/images/Id_b_18.jpg
19,944,944,"In model year 1982, a fourth Porsche model line came onto the market. The 944 bridged the price and performance gap between the 924 and the 911 SC.

Although the body of the 944 was based on the 924, it had considerably more striking contours. The 944 also featured a 2.5-liter in-line four-cylinder engine developed by Porsche. The 944 was therefore viewed as a ""true"" Porsche in the eyes of customers. This transaxle model was also produced by Audi in Neckarsulm.

A front spoiler painted in the exterior color with square rubber buffers as well as much wider, slightly angular wings clearly distinguished the 944 from the 924. The 2.5-liter engine initially developed 163 hp; a catalytic converter version with 150 hp was introduced as of MY 86. The engine with catalytic converter was tuned for unleaded fuel with 95 RON in model year 1988, which increased the power to 160 hp. For the last model year (1989), the displacement was increased to 2.7 liters and the power grew to 165 hp.

944 S (model year 1987-88)
The 944 S was identical to the 944 in body design and equipment. However, this model was equipped with a four-valve engine for the first time, which developed up to 190 hp. A badge embossed with ""16 Ventiler"" was therefore available as an option behind the flasher repeaters.

944 S2 (1989-1991)
In model year 1989, the S2 model replaced the 944 S. It had the more muscular body, rear diffusor and (as of MY 91) the rear wing of the 944 Turbo.  
The 3.0-liter four-valve engine of the 944 S2 generated 211 hp and brought the successor to the S model to a performance level that almost matched that of the Turbo model.
The 944 S2 was also available in a Cabriolet version from the very beginning.",/images/Id_b_19.jpg
20,944,944 Turbo,"January 1985 saw the launch of the 944 Turbo – the top-of-the range model in the 944 model line. This model had an aerodynamically enhanced front apron with integrated fog lights and high-beam headlights. The black rubber buffers of the 944 were omitted. Below the rear bumper was a rear diffusor painted in exterior colour. The 2.5-litre turbo engine generated 220 hp, while the Turbo S version of model year 1988 produced up to 250 hp thanks to its larger turbocharger.

For MY 1989, the 944 Turbo received the same engine as the Turbo S model and as of MY 1990 it featured a bow-shaped black rear wing.
In the last model year (1991), the 944 Turbo was also available as a Cabriolet.",/images/Id_b_20.jpg
21,959,959,"The 959 technology platform was built on the basis of the 911 model line in an exclusive series of 292 cars. With a biturbo flat engine featuring water-cooled 4-valve cylinder heads, an electronically controlled chassis and all-wheel drive system, as well as an aerodynamically optimised body, Porsche demonstrated what was possible in the field of automotive design at that time. Despite its price of 420,000 Deutschmarks, the 959 quickly sold out.",/images/Id_b_21.jpg
22,964,964,"The new generation of the 911 came onto the market in model year 1989, at the same time as the phasing-out of the G series. The 911 Carrera 4 type 964 contained 85 percent new parts, but largely retained the classic shape of its predecessor. It was available in the Coupé, Targa and Cabriolet body designs.

Despite many similarities in the design, the 964 had much better aerodynamics than the G model. This was helped in particular by the new round front and rear sections as well as an automatically extending rear spoiler.

The 911 Carrera 4 was the first 911 to feature an all-wheel drive system. Its electronically controlled permanent all-wheel drive normally transmitted 31 percent of the drive torque to the front axle and 69 percent to the rear axle. Distribution could be varied according to the relevant driving situation. There was a traction switch on the centre console of the C4. Its 3.6-litre engine produced 250 hp.

As of model year 1990, an identical rear-wheel drive version (first model with Tiptronic) was available in the form of the 911 Carrera 2 and another Turbo version as of model year 1991.",/images/Id_b_22.jpg
23,964,964 Turbo,"The 911 Turbo (type 964) had a wider body with significantly more flared wheel housings compared to the Carrera models. At the rear, the rear wing largely adopted from the Turbo 3.3 of the G model as well as two oval tailpipes emphasised the vehicle's uniqueness. Exhaust gases only escaped through the left pipe when the boost-pressure control valve of the turbocharger was open.

In model years 1991-92, the 911 Turbo was powered by a turbocharged 3.3-litre engine with 320 hp. In MY 1993, it received a 3.6-litre engine with a power output of 360 hp. One of the distinguishing features of this version were the red brake callipers.

The 911 Turbo type 964 was – with the exception of a Cabriolet limited production run – only available as a Coupé.",/images/Id_b_23.jpg
24,968,968,"The last development stage of four-cylinder transaxle models at Porsche was initiated with the 968 in model year 1992.

Most of the body parts for the successor to the 944 S2 were adopted from the previous model. Nonetheless, the front end of the 968 in particular was much more modern – and partly anticipated the front design of the later 911 (type 993).

A six-speed manual transmission and a Tiptronic transmission were available for the 968 for the first time. This model also heralded the first use of VarioCam variable intake camshaft control.
The 968 was available as a Coupé and a Cabriolet.",/images/Id_b_24.jpg
25,993,993,"In model year 1994, the 964 model line was replaced by the 993 model line. This was a significant advance, not just from a technical, but also a visual perspective.

The front wings of the 993 Carrera were wider and flatter. Because of the shorter luggage compartment lid, the black rubber lip forming the seam between the body and the front bumper on the G model and the 964 was omitted. The rear wings were also widened and ran in a straighter line towards the rear with the higher-positioned tail lights.

The 993 was initially available as a Coupé and Cabriolet with rear-wheel drive. For model year 1995, there followed the all-wheel Carrera 4 and 911 Turbo versions with viscous multi-plate clutch and in model years 1996/97, the Carrera 4S and the Carrera S.

The Targa model produced as of MY 1996 featured a large, electrically adjustable sliding roof made of tinted laminated glass instead of the removable soft top for the first time. The existing roll-over bar could therefore be dispensed with.

The Carrera and Targa models were powered by a new 3.6-litre engine, which initially developed 272 hp and 285 hp as of MY 1996.",/images/Id_b_25.jpg
26,993,993 Turbo,"In the 911 Turbo from the 993 model line, twin turbocharging was used for the first time, with one smaller turbocharger installed in each cylinder bank. It was also the first Turbo model to feature all-wheel drive.

The front apron of the Turbo had three separate air openings at the front plus air slots for brake cooling in the lower side area. The rear spoiler was completely painted in the exterior colour. Like the Carrera 4 models, the 911 Turbo also had white direction indicators at the front and red at the rear.

The 3.6-litre biturbo engine developed a power output of 408 hp as standard. As of MY 1996, a power kit for increasing power output to 430 hp was available, with 450 hp available as of MY 1998.

In MY 1995, Porsche Exclusive produced a limited production run (14 units) with the name 911 Cabriolet Turbo, which featured a particularly large rear spoiler.",/images/Id_b_26.jpg
27,986,Boxter,"From model year 1997 onwards, the Porsche Boxster set new standards for performance and safety in the open-top sports car market. The roadster combined the dynamic driving qualities of a sports car with unlimited day-to-day practicality. A new type of convertible top kinematics enabled the electrically operated top to be opened and closed in just twelve seconds – an unrivaled speed. The Boxster distinguished itself from its strongest competitors through its mid-engine concept and the six-cylinder flat engine typical of the Porsche brand. The Boxster series featured water-cooled engines.

The hood, front headlight units with low beam and high beam, indicators and fog lights, front fenders and doors were identical on the 911 Carrera and Boxster as a result of the shared parts concept.",/images/Id_b_27.jpg
28,986,Boxter S,"In model year 1999, Porsche extended the Boxster series to include the top-of-the-range Boxster S. The top model only differed from the Boxster in terms of a few visual details.

The Boxster S was powered by a 3.2-liter engine, initially with an output of 252 horsepower but this was enhanced to 260 horsepower from model year 2003 onwards.

In model year 2003, the convertible top of the Boxster series was fundamentally revised. When closed, it resembled the optional hardtop, which had an even more rounded contour.",/images/Id_b_28.jpg
29,996,911 Carrera,"With the new 911 Carrera, known internally as Generation 996, Porsche presented the successor to the classic. Apart from the name 911 Carrera and a six-cylinder flat engine at the rear, the newly developed model series had nothing in common with the previous 911.

The bodyshell of the 996 had grown significantly in size. Galvanized sheet steel and higher-strength steels were used to reinforce the body shell on both sides. The side mirrors of the series were now fixed in front of the side windows and no longer on the doors.

The hood, front headlight units with low beam and high beam, indicators and fog lights, front fenders and doors were identical on the 911 Carrera and Boxster as a result of the shared parts concept.
The series featured water-cooled engines.",/images/Id_b_29.jpg
30,996,911 Carrera 4,"In model year 1999, the 911 Carrera 4 with permanent all-wheel drive was added to the model series. It was offered as a Coupe and as a Cabriolet. Externally, the bodyshell was identical to that of the rear-wheel drive Carrera.

Based on the 911 Carrera 4 Coupe, a special model was introduced in model year 2000 to mark the coming millennium. The Millennium model was limited to 911 units and was only available in the special color Violet Chroma Flair.",/images/Id_b_30.jpg
31,996,911 Turbo,"In model year 2001, the turbo-free time at Porsche came to an end. The 911 Turbo Coupe was introduced.

Its 3.6-liter twin-turbo engine delivered 420 horsepower. The Turbo featured all-wheel drive and a six-speed manual transmission as standard.In model year 2004, a 911 Turbo Cabriolet was series-produced for the first time since 1989. The vehicle’s wide bodyshell, technology and equipment were based on the 911 Turbo.

The model range was extended in model year 2005 with the 911 Turbo S. This vehicle was available as a Coupe and as a Cabriolet. With an output of 450 horsepower, the Turbo S delivered a total of 30 horsepower more than the standard 911 Turbo.",/images/Id_b_31.jpg
32,996,911 GT2,"From model year 2001, the model range was extended to include the 911 GT2. The bodyshell of the extreme sports car was based on the bodyshell of the 911 Turbo. The GT2 engine was also based on the 911 Turbo but had ten percent more power. The twin-turbo engine delivered 462 horsepower. The GT2 was offered with a Clubsport Package for use in motorsport.

The successor to the GT2 was offered from model year 2003 onwards. The bodyshell of the new GT2 was not modified but the 3.6-liter engine had even more power. The twin-turbo engine delivered a staggering 483 horsepower. The new GT2 was also available with a Clubsport Package.",/images/Id_b_32.jpg
33,996,911 GT3,"From model year 1999, the GT3 filled the sporty niche in the model range. The GT3 had a maximum speed of 188 mph (302 km/h). The GT3 was available with a Clubsport Package for use in motorsport.

From model year 2003 onwards, the revised engine delivered even more power and reached a maximum speed of 190 mph (306 km/h).

The 911 GT3 RS, launched in model year 2004, was designed as a road-approved racing car.",/images/Id_b_33.jpg
34,980,980,"Ten years after production of the Carrera GT ended, it is now a member of the Porsche Classic family. The appearance and lines of the Type 980, which was manufactured from 2003 onwards, reveal its motor sports inheritance. While its design indicates its stylistic links with standard production vehicles, it also takes some of its features from legendary Porsche racing cars.

In this exclusive production run of only 1270 cars, the Carrera GT was powered by a ten-cylinder engine with dry-sump lubrication. The capacity of the 5.5-liter naturally aspirated V10 engine, which was originally designed for use on the track, was increased to 5.7 liters for the standard production model.

With a power output of 450 kW/612 PS at 8000 rpm and a top speed of over 330 km/h, the Carrera GT set new standards. This power was transferred to the road by manual six-speed gearbox.",/images/Id_b_34.jpg
35,Cayenne ,Cayenne ,"In model year 2003, Porsche launched its first fully offroad vehicle – the Porsche Cayenne. Initially, the Cayenne S and Cayenne Turbo were the only model variants available but Porsche added an entry-level Cayenne to expand the range in model year 2004. The launch of the Cayenne Diesel for model year 2009 saw Porsche offer a model with a diesel engine for the first time.

The bodyshell of this SUV series was around 15.7 ft (4.8 meters) long, nearly 6.6 ft (2 meters) wide and 5.6 ft (1.7 meters) tall. The front section of the Porsche Cayenne was based on the design of the 911. All Cayenne models featured all-wheel drive.

The Cayenne models with gasoline engines are powered by a water-cooled V8 engine. The Cayenne Diesel featured a V6 turbo diesel engine.",/images/Id_b_35.jpg
36,Cayenne ,Cayenne S,"In model year 2003, Porsche launched its first fully offroad vehicle – the Porsche Cayenne. Initially, the Cayenne S and Cayenne Turbo were the only model variants available.

The standard SUV bodyshell was made of fully galvanized sheet steel. Four large doors made it possible to easily access the five seats. Around 19 cubic feet (540 liters) of luggage could be stowed in the SUV. With the rear seats folded down, the loading volume could be extended to up to 41 cubic feet (1,170 liters).",/images/Id_b_36.jpg
37,Cayenne ,Cayenne Turbo,"A water-cooled V8 engine with twin-turbocharging powered the Cayenne Turbo. From model year 2005 onwards, the Cayenne Turbo was offered with an enhanced performance level. This version produced 50 horsepower more than the Cayenne Turbo without increased performance enhancement.

In model year 2006, Porsche introduced the top-of-the-range Cayenne Turbo S model.",/images/Id_b_37.jpg
38,Cayenne ,Cayenne GTS,"In model year 2008, the Cayenne series was extended to include a sporty variant – the Cayenne GTS. The Cayenne GTS series had a chassis that was specially developed for this model variant.

The Cayenne GTS Porsche Design Edition 3 was launched in model year 2010. This special edition was limited to 1,000 units.

The Cayenne GTS and the Cayenne GTS Porsche Design Edition 3 delivered 405 horsepower with their 4.8-liter V8 engines.",/images/Id_b_38.jpg
39,Cayenne ,Cayenne Diesel,"The launch of the Cayenne Diesel for model year 2009 saw Porsche offer a model with a diesel engine for the first time.

The six-cylinder V diesel engine delivered 240 horsepower.

Thanks to its 26-gallon (100-liter) tank and an average consumption of 2.5 gallons (9.3 liters) of diesel per 62 miles (100 kilometers), the Cayenne Diesel achieved a range of up to 621 miles (1,000 kilometers).",/images/Id_b_39.jpg
40,997,911 Carrera,"From 2005, the Porsche 911 was presented as being more versatile than ever before: It was available as a Coupé and Targa, Cabriolet and Speedster, with rear and all-wheel drive, a slimmer and wider bodyshell, with water-cooled naturally aspirated engines and turbo engines, as a GTS version and in the sports versions GT2, GT2 RS, GT3 and two GT3 RS versions to choose from. Including special models, the range encompasses 30 model variants — supplemented by numerous customization options.

With the design of the 997 generation, Porsche sharpened the 911 character and gave it an even more dynamic and powerful appearance. The Carrera already looks noticeably more masculine with its more strongly modeled rear, and the S, GT and Turbo models add another 44 millimeters in width. The 997 differentiates itself from its predecessor by the steeper, round, clear-glass headlights, which reference an important stylistic element of the air-cooled 911.",/images/Id_b_40.jpg
41,997,911 Carrera 4,"Like the 964, 993 and 996, the 911 of the 997 series is also available with all-wheel drive in the Carrera 4 and Carrera 4S. A new addition is the Carrera 4 GTS, which offers higher performance. In this series, the 911 Targa is only available with all-wheel drive as the Targa 4 and 4S — a novelty in the 911 series.

Due to the wider track of the all-wheel drive, the bodyshell is a slight 44 mm broader than the all-wheel drive models. Since the 2008 model improvements, the Carrera 4 models are also instantly recognizable by their continuous Red reflector strip between the tail lights.",/images/Id_b_41.jpg
42,997,911 Turbo,"In June 2006, the 911 Turbo of the 997 generation came onto the market. Thanks to charging with two exhaust turbochargers, the new Turbo 911 initially had a power output of 353 kW (480 PS). The engine was the first series gasoline engine to have turbochargers with variable turbine geometry (VTG), which were developed in cooperation with BorgWarner. The inlet-side guide vanes in the turbocharger could be adjusted dynamically.

From 2007, came the addition of the Turbo Cabriolet with a three-layer fabric top, which opened and closed within just 20 seconds.
After the facelift for model year 2010, the Turbo with its newly developed engine delivered 368 kW (500 PS), the 911 Turbo S from the same model year even had 390 kW (530 PS) and a Porsche Doppelkupplung (PDK) as standard.",/images/Id_b_42.jpg
43,997,911 GT2,"When it was launched in 2007, the 911 GT2 from the 997 series was the fastest street-legal 911 ever built. Developed by the motorsport department in Weissach, it carries all the sporty genes that a road vehicle suitable for the racetrack needs.

The GT2 is based on the widened bodyshell of the 911 Turbo, but is rear-wheel drive instead of all-wheel drive. The strong weight reduction also contributes to the stately driving performance.",/images/Id_b_43.jpg
44,997,911 GT3,"The model improvements of the 997-generation 911 GT3 the appeared in 2006. Compared to its predecessors, much of the equipment was now on board as standard, such as the Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) sports chassis.

45,987,Boxter,"In the 2005 model year, Porsche expanded the Boxster model series to include the type 987 Boxster. Visually, the new model differs greatly from its predecessors with newly designed, oval headlights and 17-inch aluminum wheels instead of 16-inch aluminum wheels on the Boxster and 18-inch aluminum wheels instead of 17-inch aluminum wheels on the Boxster S. The electric convertible top of the new Boxster can now be opened and closed at a speed of up to 50 km/h. In the 2007 model year, the rated power of the two Boxster models would be raised to the same level as the Cayman models.",/images/Id_b_45.jpg
46,987,Boxter S,"The second generation of the Boxster S is characterized by its powerful and dynamic design language and a new, more powerful drive. Visually, the Boxster S differs from the Boxster, among other things, in the twin tailpipes, the Silver logo and the brake calipers painted in Red.

The engine output was increased over the course of production from 295 PS to 310 PS. Like the Boxster, the Boxster S is available with either a manual transmission or Tiptronic S, which was replaced by the PDK in the 2009 model year.",/images/Id_b_46.jpg
47,987,Cayman,"In the 2007 model year, Porsche initially presented the Cayman with a 5-speed manual transmission and a 2.7-liter engine, thereby complementing the new model series.

48,987,Cayman S,"The Cayman S, which has been available since model year 2006, is the first Cayman generation produced in Porsche's history. The new mid-engine coupe closes the gap between the Boxster S and the 911 Carrera in terms of price and performance by being positioned above the Boxster S. The Cayman S, which is equipped with a 3.4-liter engine, has design features of the 550 Coupe from 1953 and the 904 Carrera GTS Coupe and differs significantly from the 911 Carrera in terms of design and proportions.

In April 2006, the Cayman S was voted World Performance Car of the Year for 2006 at the New York International Auto Show for its perfect combination of handling, looks and performance.",/images/Id_b_48.jpg
